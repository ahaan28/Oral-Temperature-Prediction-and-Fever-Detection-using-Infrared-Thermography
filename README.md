Both regression and classification approaches were applied. Regression models included Neural Networks, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Linear and Polynomial Regression . Classification models included Logistic Regression, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values and outliers to ensure high-quality input. Feature engineering and model tuning were performed to improve predictive performance.

The choice of models focused on matching the task, with more complex algorithms performing well for complicated patterns, and simpler models doing better with straightforward relationships. This analysis shows how important it is to choose the right approach based on the data, especially in medical applications where accuracy and reliability are crucial. By improving data preparation, optimizing models, and considering how to interpret results, this work helps make infrared thermography a useful tool for predicting temperatures without invasive methods. The findings show how machine learning can improve healthcare processes and the importance of adapting models to meet different clinical needs.
